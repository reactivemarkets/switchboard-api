# Reactive Switchboard API

The Switchboard network provides a FIX API, REST API, and a WebSocket API.

## FIX API

Please contact support@reactivemarkets.com for the latest FIX specification.

## REST API

See the [openapi](openapi/) directory for the latest OpenAPI 3.0 definition of our REST API.

See our [Developer Docs](https://developer.reactivemarkets.com) for full documentation.

## WebSocket API

The WebSocket API uses [Google Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) to binary-encode application messages trasmitted over WebSockets.
Flatbuffers provides an efficient serialisation/deserialisaton mechanism in terms of both processing
and space requirements.

See our [Developer Docs](https://developer.reactivemarkets.com) for full documentation.

### Getting Started

The Flatbuffers schema files are located in the [flatbuffers](flatbuffers/) directory.

Code can be generated for all languages supported by Flatbuffers using the `flatc` compiler:

```bash
$ flatc --rust flatbuffers/*.fbs
```

If you don't want to install flatc, you can use a docker container as a build tool.

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/api neomantra/flatbuffers:v1.12.0 bash -c "flatc --rust -o /api/build/rust /api/flatbuffers/*.fbs"
```
